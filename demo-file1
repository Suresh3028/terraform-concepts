# In Terraform, several core concepts form the foundation of its infrastructure-as-code approach. Understanding these concepts is key to effectively using Terraform for provisioning, managing, and automating infrastructure. Below are the main concepts in Terraform:

# 1. Providers
# What it is: Providers are plugins in Terraform that allow it to interact with different APIs to manage infrastructure. Providers are responsible for defining resources and managing the lifecycle of those resources.
# Example: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and many others.
# Usage: You specify a provider in your configuration to interact with the respective platform's resources.
# hcl
# Copy code
# provider "aws" {
#   region = "us-west-2"
# }
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Resources
# What it is: A resource is an entity that Terraform manages, such as a virtual machine, storage bucket, or security group. Resources are the most essential components of a Terraform configuration.
# Example: Creating an AWS EC2 instance or an S3 bucket.
# Usage: Define resources in your .tf files to instruct Terraform on what to create and manage.
# hcl
# Copy code
# resource "aws_instance" "example" {
#   ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
#   instance_type = "t2.micro"
# }
# ____________________________________________
# 3. Variables
# What it is: Variables allow you to parameterize your configuration files, making them more reusable and flexible. You can define input values for things like instance types, regions, or any other configurable parameters.
# Example: Declaring variables for instance size or region.
# Usage: Declare variables using variable blocks, and reference them with ${var.variable_name}.
# hcl
# Copy code
# variable "instance_type" {
#   type    = string
#   default = "t2.micro"
# }
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Outputs
# What it is: Outputs allow you to extract useful information about the resources you've created or modified. You can use outputs to display resource details after Terraform applies the configuration.
# Example: You might want to output the IP address of a provisioned EC2 instance.
# Usage: Declare outputs in your .tf files, and Terraform will display their values after execution.
# hcl
# Copy code
# output "instance_ip" {
#   value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
# }
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 5. Modules
# What it is: Modules are reusable configurations that allow you to encapsulate a set of resources into a single unit. They make it easy to reuse and share infrastructure code.
# Example: A module for setting up a complete VPC with subnets, security groups, and instances.
# Usage: You can define your own modules or use publicly available ones from the Terraform Registry.
# hcl
# Copy code
# module "vpc" {
#   source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
#   name   = "my-vpc"
#   cidr   = "10.0.0.0/16"
# }
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 6. State
# What it is: Terraform maintains a state file (terraform.tfstate) that records the current state of the infrastructure. This is how Terraform knows what resources it manages, what needs to be updated, and what to destroy.
# Example: When you run terraform apply, Terraform compares the current configuration with the state file and makes the necessary changes.
# Usage: It is important to store state files securely, especially in team environments. You can use remote backends (like AWS S3, Terraform Cloud, etc.) to store the state file.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 7. Data Sources
# What it is: Data sources allow Terraform to query information about existing resources that are not managed by Terraform. These resources could be created outside Terraform but need to be referenced in the configuration.
# Example: Looking up an existing AMI or fetching information about a security group.
# Usage: You can reference data sources in the same way you reference resources.
# hcl
# Copy code
# data "aws_ami" "latest" {
#   most_recent = true
#   owners      = ["amazon"]
#   filters = {
#     name = "amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"
#   }
# }
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 8. Provisioners
# What it is: Provisioners allow you to execute scripts or commands on the resources after they are created. For example, you might want to install software on a VM after it's provisioned.
# Example: Running a script to configure a server or installing dependencies.
# Usage: Terraform has built-in provisioners like local-exec and remote-exec to run commands locally or remotely.
# hcl
# Copy code
# resource "aws_instance" "example" {
#   ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
#   instance_type = "t2.micro"

#   provisioner "remote-exec" {
#     inline = [
#       "sudo apt-get update",
#       "sudo apt-get install -y nginx"
#     ]
#   }
# }


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 9. Backend
# What it is: Backends determine where Terraform's state is stored and how operations are performed. A backend can be local (on your computer) or remote (in cloud storage like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Terraform Cloud).
# Example: Using an S3 bucket as a remote backend to store state files.
# Usage: Configure a backend in the Terraform configuration file.
# hcl
# Copy code
# terraform {
#   backend "s3" {
#     bucket = "my-tf-state"
#     key    = "path/to/my/key"
#     region = "us-west-2"
#   }
# }


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 10. Terraform Commands
# What it is: Terraform comes with a set of commands for managing your infrastructure lifecycle.
# terraform init: Initializes your working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
# terraform plan: Previews the actions Terraform will take to reach the desired state.
# terraform apply: Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.
# terraform destroy: Destroys all resources managed by the configuration.
# terraform validate: Validates your configuration files.
# terraform fmt: Formats your Terraform files according to a standard style.
# 11. Workspace
# What it is: Workspaces are used to manage multiple environments (like dev, staging, and prod). They allow you to have different state files for each environment.
# Usage: You can create and switch between workspaces using terraform workspace commands.
# bash
# Copy code
# terraform workspace new prod
# terraform workspace select dev
